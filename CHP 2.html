        New Scientist,</em> and all the other</br > sientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy <cite>
        On The Road.</cite> It has been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she </br >spent in these four walls the more she
        felt she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster with an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that <q>Work is the 
        refuge of who have</br> nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets Ilama <b>DNA</b>,
        to be an outstanding achievement, Molly </br> <em>did </em>thing she had something better to do.
